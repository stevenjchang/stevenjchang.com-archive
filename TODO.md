Idea for portfolio page
* for your demo/portfolio projects section
  * each section should have the hero of the project's landing page as a bg
  * it should have a number, hovering on the left
  * it could have a video.
  * I like how clean this page is https://stampfans.com/

Shark tank idea. Let's come up with one thing.

So the basic UI.
- User should be able to select the season they are on
- User should be able to select the episode they are on
  
Let's do mobile first
- Should it be accordian style, swipe style, or one by one?

There should be comments. 
Navbar should show the state of which episode they are in

Conclusion:
Build a component called Season?
  It should have a status bar. Status bar shows season number, episode number. 
  It should have a second status bar, shows product number.
  It should have rating(s)
  It should have comment bubble (plus highlighted comment)
